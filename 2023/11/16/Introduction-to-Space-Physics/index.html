                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Solar-Terrestrial physics is principally concerned with the
interaction of energetic charged particles with the electic and magnetic
fields in space. In the vicinity of the earth, most of these charged
particles derive their energy ultimately from the sun or from the
interaction of the solar wind with the earth's magnetosphere. These
interactions are complex, because the magnetic and electric fields that
determine the motion of the particles are affected in turn by the motion
of these charged particles. Some solar-terrestrial research is carried
out on the surface of the earth with cameras, photometers and
spectrometers, and magnetometers and other devices sensitive to the
processes occuring high in the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere, but
today most of this research is carried out using rockets and satellites
that enable measurements to be obtained directly in the regions of
strongest interactions. In recent years, these in situ data have
resulted in explosive growth in our knowledge and understanding of
solar-terrestrial processes. Nevertheless, the field has had a long
history of investigation, starting well before the advent of satellites
and rockets. We shall briefly review that history in order to provide a
context for our later, more physically oriented presentation of the
processes occuring in the solar terrestrial environment.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-auroral-sightings">Ancient auroral sightings</h2>
<p>The emerging field of solar-terrestrial physics began with a growing
appreciation of two phenomena: the aurora and, later, the geomagnetic
field. Because it can be observed visually, the aurora was the first of
these phenomena to be recorded. Most other phenomena of this emerging
field awaited the advent of new technology, such as the compass in the
case of geomagnetism, before they were discovered. References to the
aurora are contained in the ancient literature from both East and West.
Several passages in the Old Testament appear to ahve been inspired by
auroral sightings, and Greek literature includes references to phenomena
most likely to have been auroral phenomena. For example, Xenophanes, in
the sixth centry B.C., mentions "moving accumulations of burning
clouds." Chinese literature also describes possible auroral sightings,
of which several occured prior to 2000 B.C.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spaceintro_1570_aurora.png" /></p>
<p>Because the phenomenon was not understood, much fear and superstition
surrounded those early sightings of the aurora. The above figure
illustrates the lack of scientific understanding of prevalent at that
time. The seventeenth century marked the beginning of scientific
theories concerning the origin of the lights in the north. Galileo
Galilei, for example, proposed that the aurora was caused by air rising
out of the earth's shadow to where it could be illuminated by sunlight.
He also appears to have coined the term aurora borealis, meaning "dawn
of the north." Pierre Gassendi, a French mathematician and astronomer,
at about the same time, deduced that auroral displays must be occurring
at great heights, because they were seen to have the same configuration
when observed at places quite remote from one another. His contemporary,
René Descartes, seems to have been the originator of the idea that
auroras were caused by reflections from ice crystals in the air at high
latitudes. From about 1645 to about 1715, both solar activity and
auroral sightings declined, although neither were completely
lacking.</p>
<p>Edmund Halley, after finally, at the age of 60, having personally
observed an auroral display, seems to have been the first to suggest
that the auroral phenomenon was ordered by the direction of the earth's
magnetic field. In 1731, the French philosopher de Mairan ridiculed the
currently popular idea that the aurora was a reflection of polar ice and
snow, and he also criticized Halley's theory. He suggested that the
aurora was connected to the solar atmosphere, and he suspected a
connection between the return of sunspots and the aurora. After that
time, studies of geomagnetism and the aurora became more firmly
linked.</p>
<h2 id="early-measurements-of-the-geomagnetic-field">Early measurements
of the geomagnetic field</h2>
<p>The earliest indication of the existence of the geomagnetic field was
the direction-finding capability of the compass. As compasses were
improved, more and more was learned about the geomagnetic field. The
earliest reliable evidence of Chinese knowledge that a compass points
north or south dates from the eleventh century. The encyclopedist
Shon-Kau (A.D. 1030-93) stated that "fortune-tellers rub the point of a
needle with the stone of the magnet in order to make it properly
indicate the south.* In the European literature, the earliest mention of
the compass and its application to navigation appeared in two works by
Alexander Neekan, a monk of St. Albans (A.D. 1157-217), entitled De
Untensilibus and De Rerum. In the former he described the use of the
magnetic needle to indicate north and noted that mariners used that
means to find their course when the sky was cloudy. In the second, he
described the needle as being placed on a pivot, a second-generation
form of the compass. In neither work did he describe the instrument as a
novelty; it was in common use at that time. Official records indicate
that by the fourteenth century, many sailing ships carried
compasses.</p>
<p>The direction of magnetic north and that of geographic or true north
differ over most of the globe. The measure of this difference is called
the declination. It is not clear when magnetic declination was actually
discovered. However, a letter written by Georg Hartmann, vicar of St.
Sebald's at Nürnberg, to Duke Albrecht of Prussia in 1544 showed that he
had observed the declination of Rome in 1510 to be 6° east, whereas it
was 10° at Nürnberg. Also, it is known that between the years 1538 and
1541, João de Castro made 43 determinations of declination during a
voyage along the west coast of India and in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more im-portant, on April 5, 1741, Hiorter discovered
that geomagnetic and auroral activities were correlated. Simultaneous
observations in London by Graham confirmed the occurrence of strong
geomagnetic activity on that day. In 1770, J. C. Wilcke noted that
auroral rays extend upward along the direction of the magnetic field.
That was the same year that Captain James Cook first reported the
southern counterpart of the aurora borealis, the aurora australis, or
"dawn of the south." Twenty years later, the English scientist Henry
Cavendish used triangulation to estimate the height of auroras as
between 52 and 71 miles. Earlier attempts at triangulation by Halley and
Mairan had been much less accurate.</p>
<p>The great advance of the early nineteenth century was the develop
ment of a network to make frequent simultaneous observations with widely
spaced magnetometers. C. F. Gauss was one of the leaders o that effort
and one of the foremost pioneers in the mathematical analysis of the
resulting measurements, which allowed contributions to the geo magnetic
field from below the surface of the earth to be separated from those
contributions arising high in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Heinrich
Schwabe, on the basis of his sunspot measurements taken between 1825 and
1850, deduced that the variation in the number of sunspots was periodic,
with a period of about 10 yr. Magnetic observatories had spread to the
British colonies by 1839. Edward Sabine was assigned to supervise four
of those observatories (Toronto, St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope, and
Hobarton). Using the data from those observatories, he was able to show
in 1851 that the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances varied in concert
with the sunspot cycle.</p>
<p>The next discovery to provide a link between the sun and geomagnetic
activity was Richard Carrington's sighting of a great flare of white
light on the sun, on September 1, 1859. Carrington, who was sketching
sunspot groups at the time, was startled by the flare, and by the time
he was able to summon someone to witness the event a minute later, he
was dismayed to find that it had weakened greatly in intensity.
Fortu-nately, it had been simultaneously noted by another observer some
miles away. Furthermore, at the moment of the flare, the Kew Observatory
(London) measurements of the magnetic field had been disturbed. Today we
realize that that disturbance of the magnetic field was caused by an
increase in the electric currents flowing overhead in the earth's
iono-sphere. Such currents flow in response to electric fields in the
iono-sphere. The extreme radiation by ultraviolet rays and x-rays from
the flare increased the ionization and hence the electrical conductivity
of the ionosphere, causing more current to flow in response to the
unaltered electric field. Finally, 18 h later, one of the strongest
magnetic storms ever recorded broke out. Auroras were seen as far south
as Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>To have arrived that quickly, the disturbance would have had to
travel from the sun at over 2,300 <span class="math inline">\(km\cdot
s^{-1}\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(2,300 km\cdot
s^{-1}\)</span> is a high velocity even for the disturbed solar wind.
When such disturbances arrive at the earth, the terrestrial field jumps
quite abruptly, indicating that the discontinuity in the interplanetary
medium that is flowing by the earth is quite thin. The thinness of these
disturbance fronts strongly suggests that they are caused by shocks in
the interplanetary medium, despite the collisionless nature of the gas
there. Usually, collisions are needed to account for the dissipation and
heating that occur at a shock. That was the first indication of the
existence of collisionless shocks, which since the advent of
interplanetary exploration have been found to be ubiquitous in the solar
system. Shortly after those observations, in 1861, Balfour Stewart noted
the occurrence of pulsations in the earth's magnetic field, with periods
of minutes. We now know that the magnetosphere pulsates at a wide
variety of periods.</p>
<p>Precursors to our modern understanding of the aurora began to appear
in the late nineteenth century. About 1878, H. Becquerel suggested that
particles were shot off from the sun and were guided by the earth's
magnetic field to the auroral zone. He believed that sunspots ejected
protons. A similar theory was espoused by E. Goldstein. In 1897, the
great Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland made his first auroral
expedition to northern Norway. However, it was not until after his third
expedition in 1902-3, during which he obtained extensive data on the
magnetic perturbations associated with auroras, that he concluded that
large electric currents flowed along magnetic-field lines during
aurora.</p>
<p>The invention of the vacuum tube led to the understanding that the
aurora was in some way similar to the cathode rays in those devices.
Soon Sir William Crookes demonstrated that cathode rays were bent by
magnetic fields, and shortly thereafter J. J. Thomson showed that
cathode rays consisted of the tiny, negatively charged particles we now
call electrons. Birkeland adopted those ideas for his auroral theories
and attempted to verify his theories with both field observations and
laboratory experiments. Specifically, he conducted experiments with a
magnetic dipole inside a model earth, which he called a terrella. Those
experiments showed that electrons incident on the terrella would produce
patterns quite reminiscent of the auroral zone.</p>
<p>K. Birkeland's work inspired the Norwegian mathematician Carl
Stormer, whose subsequent calculations of the motion of charged
particles in a dipole magnetic field in turn supported Birkeland. As is
evident from this photograph, the advent of the camera was an important
advance in the study of the aurora. It was through measurements such as
these that Stormer accurately determined the height of the aurora.</p>
<h2 id="the-ionosphere-and-magnetosphere">The ionosphere and
magnetosphere</h2>
<p>The electrically conducting region above about 100 km altitude that
we now call the ionosphere may rightly be claimed to have been
discovered by Balfour Stewart. In his 1882 Encyclopaedia Britannica
article entitled "Terrestrial Magnetism" he concluded that the upper
atmosphere was the most probable location of the electric currents that
produce the solar-controlled variation in the magnetic field measured at
the surface of the earth. He noted that "we know from our study of
aurora that there are such currents in these regions - continuous near
the poles and occasional in lower latitudes." He proposed that the
primary causes of the daily variations in the intensity of the surface
magnetic field were "convective currents established by the sun's
heating influence in the upper regions of the atmosphere." These
currents "are to be regarded as conductors moving across lines of
magnetic force and are thus the vehicle of electric currents which act
upon the magnetic field." Those statements are very close to modern
atmospheric-dynamo theory. How-ever, it was left to A. Schuster to put
the dynamo theory into quantitative form.</p>
<p>The turn of the century brought another new invention that was used
to probe the solar-terrestrial environment: the radio transmitter and
receiver. In 1902, A.E. Kennelly and O. Heaviside independently
postulated the existence of a highly electrically conducting ionosphere
to explain G. Marconi's transatlantic radio transmissions. Verification
of the existence of the ionosphere did not come until much later, in
1925, when E.V.Appleton and M.A.F. Barnett in the UK, and shortly
thereafter G.Breit and M.A. Tuve in America, established the existence
and altitude of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, as it was known hen. The
original method of Breit and Tuve, using short pulses of radio energy at
vertical incidence and timing the arrival of a reflected signal in order
to infer the altitude of the electrically reflecting layer, is still
used today for sounding the ionosphere. In drawing diagrams of the
electromagnetic waves reflected by the ionosphere, ppleton used the
letter E for the electric vector of the downcoming wave. When he found
reflections from a higher layer, he used letter F for the electric
vector of those reflected waves, and when he occasionally got
reflections from a lower layer, he naturally used the letter D. When it
came time to name these layers, he chose the same letters, leaving the
letters A,B and C for possible later discoveries that never came. So now
the ionospheric layers are called the D,E,a nd F layers. We now know
that all planets with atmospheres have electrically conducting
ionospheres like that of the earth.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spaceintro_DEF.png" /></p>
<p>At about that same time, progress was being made in understanding the
auroral glows. Spectroscopy, together with photography, permitted first
the determination of the wavelength and then the identity of the excited
molecule that was radiating. There were initial successes, beginning
with Lars Vegard's work in Norway relating auroral emissions to emission
bands from known atmospheric gases such as nitrogen. However,
identification of the yellow-green line at 557.7 nm was elusive.</p>
<p>Finally, H. Babcock's precise measurements in 1923 allowed John
McLennan to identify it as a metastable transition of atomic oxygen. At
atmospheric pressures close to that at the surface of the earth,
collisions between molecules de-excite the molecules before they have a
chance to radiate if they happen to become excited into one of the
metastable states. However, at the altitude of the aurora, collisions
are so rare that the time between collisions is longer than the
lifetimes of the metastable states, and the excitation energy of the
state can be released by radia-tion. A similar line in the auroral
spectrum is the 630.0-m red line of atomic oxygen. This metastable
transition has a lifetime of 110s and can radiate only above some 250
km. Those discoveries led to the realization that the varied colors of
the aurora were simply related to
height.(按：因为不同高度，平均自由程不同，则碰撞频率不同，则会发生不同的辐射。对于碰撞强的地方，metastable的辐射在发生之前就被collision
de-excite了，所以不会发生) In low-altitude auroras, below 100 km, where
collisions quench even the oxygen green line, the blue and red nitrogen
bands predominate. From 100 to 250 km, the oxygen green line is
strongest. Above 250 km, the red line is most important.</p>
<p>Although most of the auroral forms are associated with electrons,
some aurora are due to precipitating protons. The first observations of
the proton aurora were made in 1939. Measurements of the Doppler shifts
of the proton emissions permitted estimates of the energy of the
precipitating particles from the ground.</p>
<p>With the concept of the ionosphere firmly established, scientists
began to wonder about the <strong>upper extension of the
ionosphere</strong>, linked magnetically to the earth, <strong>which
region we today call the magnetosphere</strong>. In 1918, Sydney Chapman
postulated a singly-charged beam from the sun as the cause of worldwide
magnetic disturbances. That was a revival of an old idea that had
previously been criticized by Schuster.Chapman was soon challenged by
Frederick Lindemann, who pointed out that mutual electrostatic repulsion
would destroy such a stream. Lindemann, instead, suggested that the
stream of charged particles contained particles of both signs in equal
numbers. We would now call such a stream a <strong>"plasma."</strong>
That proposal was a breakthrough, and it permitted Chapman and his
co-workers, in a series of papers beginning in 1930, to lay the
foundations for our modern understanding of the interaction of the solar
wind with the magnetosphere.</p>
<p>In the rarefied conditions of outer space, where collisions between
particles are infrequent, the ion-electron gas, or plasma, is highly
electrically conducting. Thus, Chapman and Ferraro proposed that as the
plasma from the sun approached the earth, the earth would effectively
see a mirror magnetic-dipole moment advancing on the earth. The net
result of that advancing mirror field would be to compress the
terrestrial field. Eventually, the plasma would surround the earth on
all sides, and a cavity would be carved out of the solar plasma by the
terrestrial magnetic field. That is very similar to our modern concept
of the geomagnetic cavity.</p>
<p><img src="/images/spaceintro_chapman.png" /></p>
<p><strong>After the compression of the magnetosphere, which is detected
by ground-based magnetometers as a sharp increase in the magnetic field,
the magnetosphere becomes inflated.</strong> Chapman and Ferraro
correctly interpreted that subsequent decrease in the magnetic field at
the surface of the earth as the appearance of energetic plasma deep
inside the magnetosphere, forming a ring of current around the earth in
the near-equatorial regions. The development of this ring current in
what we now call a geomagnetic storm is discussed at greater length
later.</p>
<p>At the same time that the ionosphere was being discovered by virtue
of its effects on man-made radio signals, natural radio emissions were
also being explored, and the magneto-jonic theory developed for the
man-made signals was being applied to those natural emissions. The first
report of those electromagnetic signals in the audio-frequency range was
an observation of what have become known as
"<strong>whistlers</strong>,"(当时一直有这种噪声干扰无线电波通讯) coming
from a 22-km telephone line in Austria in 1886. Whistlers are short
bursts of audio-frequency radio noise of continuously decreasing pitch.
In 1894, British telephone operators heard "weeks," possibly whistlers
generated by lightning, and a "dawn chorus" generated deep in the
magnetosphere during a display of aurora borealis. Little work was done
on those observations because of the lack of suitable analysis equipment
at the time. During World War I, equipment installed to eavesdrop on
enemy telephone conversations picked up whistling sounds. Soldiers at
the front would say, "You could hear the grenades fly." H. Barkhausen
reported on those observations in 1919 and suggested that they were
correlated with meteorological influences. However, he could not
duplicate the phenomenon in laboratory experiments. In 1925, T. L.
Ecker-sley also described that phenomenon and ascribed it to the
dispersion of an electrical impulse in a medium loaded with free ions.
Eventually, after much work and several incorrect explanations, in 1935
Eckersley concluded that the distinctive swooping sound of whistlers was
due to the dispersion of a burst of electromagnetic noise traveling
through the ionosphere. Very little work was done on whistlers until the
early 1950s, at which time L. R. O. Storey, with a homemade spectrum
analyzer, conducted a thorough study of whistlers. He found that
whistlers are caused by lightning flashes, whose electromagnetic energy
then echoes back and forth along field lines in the upper ionosphere, as
illustrated in Figure 1.10. A major implication of those findings was
that the electron density in the outer ionosphere, which is now called
the plasmasphere, was unexpectedly high. Storey also found other types
of audio-frequency, or very low frequency (VLF), emissions that are not
associated with lightning and are now known to be generated within the
magnetospheric plasma.</p>
<h2 id="the-solar-wind">The solar wind</h2>
<p>If the auroras were caused by electrons, and if those electrons came
from the sun, as was commonly believed among solar-terrestrial
researchers in the first half of the twentieth century, then those
electrons would have to travel in the company of an equal number of
ions, or else the beam would disrupt. <strong>That idea can be
considered the first model of the streaming ionized plasma of
interplanetary space that we call the solar wind.</strong> It was an
essential element of the geomagnetic-storm model of Chapman and Ferraro,
but in their model the solar wind was intermit-tent. It flowed only at
active times. However, in 1943, C. Hoffmeister noted that a comet tail
was not strictly radial, but lagged behind the comet's radial direction
by about 5°. In 1951, L. Biermann correctly interpreted that lag in
terms of an interaction between the comet tail and a solar wind.
<strong>That wind was said to flow at about 450 <span
class="math inline">\(km \cdot s^{-1}\)</span> at all times and in all
directions from the sun</strong>, although he assumed that the electron
density was about 600 cm -3, two orders of magnitude too high. Several
years later, in 1957, Hannes Alfven postulated that the solar wind was
magnetized and that the solar-wind flow draped that magnetic field over
the comet, forming a long magnetic tail downstream in the antisolar
direction, as illustrated in Figure 1.11.(A plasma system, or process,
is said to be magnetized if its characteristic lengthscale, <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, is large compared to the gyroradius.)
The cometary ions were confined by that tail in a narrow ribbon between
the two tail "lobes." In 1958, E. W. Parker provided the theoretical
underpinning for such a flow of magnetized plasma, and in 1962 he showed
that in order to be consistent with the geomagnetic records, the
electron density of the solar wind should seldom exceed 30 cm 3.
Confirmation was not long in coming. <strong>That was the dawn of the
space age</strong>, and soon observations were being returned by both
Soviet and American space probes that clearly confirmed the existence of
the solar wind and its entrained magnetic field, measured its
properties, and demonstrated its pivotalrole in controlling geomagnetic
activity and the aurora.</p>
